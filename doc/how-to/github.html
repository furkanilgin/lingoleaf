<h1>How To Use GitHub</h1>
<p>We will use the Fork & Pull Model of GitHub. It lets anyone fork an existing repository and push changes to their personal fork without requiring access be granted to the source repository. The changes must then be pulled into the source repository by the project maintainer. This model reduces the amount of friction for new contributors and is popular with open source projects because it allows people to work independently without upfront coordination.</p>

<p>How to contribute any contents to the original repository<br>
Fork the original repository under your username and read <a href="http://matthew-brett.github.io/pydagogue/git_gui_windows.html">this</a> tutorial.<br>
