<h1>Questions</h1>
<b>Which database framework and ORM shall we use?</b><br>
<i>Aasheesh Choudhary</i> I also vote for hibernate and mysql..we can opt for mongodb too..it's fast..let's c d vote count..<br>
<i>Admin</i> I also prefer MySQL and Hibernate. While we are developing we need to take into account that we might have different platform later on so we need to provide flexible code.<br>
<i>Pradeep Simha</i> While developing we should make sure that it should be easy to change ORM layer/database later.. API based approach maybe good here, I feel..
